# Data Breach at a Social Media Company

## 4️⃣ Data Breach at a Social Media Company

### 1️⃣ Classify the types of data exposed (PII or not)

In this scenario, the leaked data — including user passwords, private messages, and location histories — is clearly **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**. PII is any information that can directly or indirectly identify a person. Passwords link to specific user accounts, messages can reveal highly sensitive conversations, and location histories show where individuals have been, making this type of data extremely private and valuable to attackers.

### 2️⃣ What were likely technical and human errors that caused the breach?

The breach likely resulted from a mix of technical flaws and human errors. Technically, the platform may have stored passwords without proper hashing and salting, leaving them exposed in plain text. Misconfigured servers, outdated software, or unpatched vulnerabilities could also have provided attackers an entry point. On the human side, employees might have fallen victim to phishing emails that gave attackers credentials to access internal systems. Weak password policies for admin accounts or failure to monitor suspicious activity often worsen such breaches. Poor cryptographic key management, as discussed in the CipherSchools video, can further weaken the company’s defense against unauthorized access.

### 3️⃣ How does this case reflect the broader need for cybersecurity?

This case shows why robust cybersecurity practices are crucial for organizations that handle large volumes of sensitive user data. Social media companies store vast amounts of PII, making them prime targets for cybercriminals. Without strong encryption, proper access controls, and staff training to counter phishing and social engineering, even the biggest platforms remain vulnerable. As the CipherSchools video explains, both **symmetric encryption** (to protect stored data) and **asymmetric encryption** (for secure authentication and communication) must be standard practices. Regular audits, vulnerability scans, and an up-to-date incident response plan are also essential. Ultimately, protecting user trust and privacy depends on continuous investment in technical security measures, employee awareness, and strong governance.
